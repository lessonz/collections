collections
===========

This project will contain collections I design for general use.

BucketPRKDTree
------------

This is a Bucket, Point-Region, K-Dimensional Tree. While it is technically correct, its object-oriented nature has resulted in some serious performance compromises. It is my current opinion this particular data structure is not well suited to "good" object-oriented design. Please feel free to use it, but for systems requiring the highest performance consider some serious performance optimizations.
